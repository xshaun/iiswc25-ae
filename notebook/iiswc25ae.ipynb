    "# Artifact Evaluation (AE) for ''Sweet or Sour CHERI: Performance Characterization of the Arm Morello Platform'' IISWC 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains the artifacts and workflows necessary to reproduce the experimental results and figures presented in the IISWC 2025 paper by X. Sun, J. Singer, and Z. Wang. \n",
    "\n",
    "**abstract**\n",
    "\n",
    "Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) offer a hardware-based approach to enhance memory safety by enforcing strong spatial and temporal memory protections. This paper presents the largest performance analysis of the CHERI architecture on the ARM Morello platform seen to date. Using on-chip performance monitoring counters (PMCs), we evaluate 20 C/C++ applications, including the SPEC CPU2017 suite, SQL database engine, JavaScript engine, and large language model inference, across three CHERI Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our results show that performance penalties of CHERI range from negligible to 1.65x, with the most significant impact apparent in pointer-intensive and memory-sensitive workloads. These overheads are primarily caused by increased memory traffic and L1/L2 cache pressure from 128-bit capabilities. However, our projections suggest that these overheads can be significantly reduced with modest microarchitectural changes, and that a mature, optimized implementation could achieve memory safety with minimal performance impact. We hope these findings provide valuable guidance for the design of future, performance-optimized memory security features.\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware \n",
    "- [ARM Morello prototype board](https://www.arm.com/architecture/cpu/morello) running [CheriBSD 25.03](https://www.cheribsd.org/).\n",
    "- Intel-based machine running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for cross-compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software dependencies\n",
    "- [cheribuild commit:b529760afc01d9e](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild).\n",
    "- Python 3.10, git, ssh, autoconf, automake, etc. \n",
    "- All remaining dependencies, including [morello/llvm-project](https://git.morello-project.org/morello/llvm-project.git), compiled with [cheribuild](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above software dependencies can be installed on Ubuntu with the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ sudo apt update \n",
    "$ sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config clang bison cmake mercurial ninja-build samba flex texinfo time libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev libarchive-dev libarchive-tools libbz2-dev libattr1-dev libcap-ng-dev libexpat1-dev libgmp-dev bc\n",

    "**A few bash scripts take more than half an hour to complete; Please wait for the results before executing the next one.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overload might lead to a longer wait for results. This issue may occur if multiple reviewers simultaneously run the scripts to generate results. One possible way of avoiding this is to check the running process by `ps aux` before executing any other script.\n",

The proportion of data-processing instructions (DP_SPEC) increases substantially, ranging from 5.21% to 29.31%, reflecting the additional arithmetic operations required for capability manipulation and bounds checking. By contrast, the proportions of load (LD_SPEC) and store (ST_SPEC) instructions remain relatively stable, with standard deviations of 2.01% and 1.47%, respectively. These results suggest that memory access patterns are largely unaffected, while computational demands increase significantly.

    "The increase in CAP_MEM_ACCESS_RD directly drives the rise in L1I miss rates, demonstrating that performance degradation stems from the additional capability memory operations introduced by CHERI. While MEM_ACCESS_RD_CTAG records tag-dependent memory accesses without explicitly capturing tag-check latency—likely pipelined with memory operations—the high frequency of these events confirms heavy reliance on CHERI’s memory protection mechanisms. More fundamentally, CHERI’s safety guarantees and capability manipulations enforce a tightly coupled execution pattern that binds instruction-level behavior to memory system performance. This coupling manifests in the strong correlations among cache refills, TLB walks, and stall cycles, (§4.8)."

In version two, purecap mode incurs significant overhead at -O0, minimal overhead at -O3, and achieves its best performance at -O1. These results suggest that traditional compiler optimization strategies may need to be reconsidered in the CHERI context, (§4.9)."
